Don't Be a Jerk
====

The "Don't Be a Jerk" or "DBaJ" non-commercial care-free license is designed for use licensing computer programming code and compiled binaries. 

Not that it can't be used for anything else, but that's what it was designed for. 

Feel free to fork, tweak, and re-use some or all of the license for your own purposes. At some point in time, I'll probably make it non-specific, so you won't have to fork it if you want to use it.

Specifically, it's intended to be used to license Minecraft mods.

Read the license. You might just like it.


UPDATE: In the next few months, I'll be switching my mods over to the [MMPLv2](https://github.com/jakimfett/MMPLv2). This license won't go away, but I won't be updating it, and I'd recommend that it not be use for new mods.
